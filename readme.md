# Decentralized Traceability and Direct Marketing of Agricultural Supply Chain



<br>

 ### Abstract: 
  The agriculture sector is facing the major challenges because of the absence of direct supply chain between farmers and buyers. This will lead to vulnerabilities, reduce the farmers income and compromises product quality. To address these issues, we are developing a web portal which facilitates the visibility of farmers profiles making their details accessible to the wide range of buyers. This approach lets buyers to connect with farmers through the portal, allowing them to negotiate and quickly update price agreements.
		To enhance transparency and security, our system incorporates Blockchain technology to record and securely store all transactions. Our innovative web portal strives to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers promoting transparency and trust in agriculture transactions. This approach has the potential to benefit both farmers and consumers while promoting sustainable practices within the agricultural sector.


 ### Objectives:
1. To design a web portal that facilitates farmers to sell their products in a direct and transparent manner.
2. To bridge the gap between farmers and buyers, promoting transparency, traceability, and trust in agricultural transactions by providing a digital platform for them to connect which helps farmers to get better pricing for their crops.
