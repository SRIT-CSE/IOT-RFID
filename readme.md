## Decentralized Traceability and Direct Selling of Agricilture Supply 
<br>

 ### Abstract: 
    The agriculture sector faces a significant challenge due to middlemen fraudulence, resulting in increased costs and reduced farmer income. To address this, we propose a portal powered by IoT and blockchain technology for transparent agricultural product trading. 

    This platform empowers farmers to directly sell their products, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring accurate product information. IoT enables real-time tracking, while blockchain guarantees tamper-proof traceability. By decentralizing the system, we enhance security and reduce middlemen fraud, ultimately benefiting farmers and consumers.

 ### Objectives:
  1. ***Eliminate Middlemen Fraudulence***
  2. ***Enhance Traceability and Security with Blockchain***
