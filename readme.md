## Decentralized Traceability and Direct Selling of Agricilture Supply 
<br>

 ### Abstract: 
   The agriculture sector faces a significant challenge due to middlemen fraudulence, resulting in increased costs and reduced farmer income. To address this, we propose a portal powered by blockchain technology for transparent agricultural product trading. 

  This platform empowers farmers to directly sell their products, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring accurate product information. Blockchain guarantees tamper-proof traceability. By decentralizing the system, we enhance security and reduce middlemen fraud, ultimately benefiting farmers and consumers.

 ### Objectives:
  1. ***Eliminate Middlemen Fraudulence***
  2. ***Enhance Traceability and Security with Blockchain***
